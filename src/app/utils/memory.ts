 * Base64 encoding increases the file size by approximately 33%. It converts
 * every 3 bytes of binary data into 4 bytes of ASCII characters. This overhead
 * is necessary to represent binary data in a text-based format. To estimate the
 * approximate size of the Base64 representation of a file, you can use the following formula:
 * Base64Size â‰ˆ (OriginalFileSize * 4) / 3
